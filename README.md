# Hybrid Network Design and Implementation – MSc Project

## 📌 Overview

This project presents the design and simulation of a small enterprise hybrid network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network integrates both wired and wireless environments to ensure scalability, reliability, and security. The design reflects real-world enterprise networking by combining dynamic routing, secure wireless connectivity, and efficient IP addressing.
